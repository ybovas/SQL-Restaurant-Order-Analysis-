# SQL-Restaurant-Order-Analysis-

📌 Business Objective:
---------------------

The primary goal of this project is to analyze restaurant data to understand menu pricing, customer ordering behavior, and sales performance.
Using SQL Server (MSSQL), we explore tables (menu_items, order_details) to derive insights that can help the business optimize its offerings, pricing strategy, and inventory planning.

📊 Project Summary

This project focuses on three major objectives:

Objective 1 – Explore the Menu
- Determine the total number of items on the menu
- Identify the least and most expensive items
- Find the number of dishes by category
- Calculate the average price per category

Objective 2 – Explore Orders
- Analyze order trends and date ranges
- Find the number of orders and items sold
- Identify orders with the highest number of items
- Detect large-volume orders (more than 12 items)

Objective 3 – Customer Behavior Analysis
- Combine menu and order tables for detailed insights
- Discover most and least ordered items & categories
- Identify top 5 highest-spending orders
- Break down purchase details of high-value orders

🛠️ Solution Approach

The project was built in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) using structured queries, including:
- Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- Grouping & Filtering (GROUP BY, HAVING, TOP, subqueries)
- Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
- Exploratory Queries to inspect data patterns

🔑 Sample Insights

Menu Analysis
- Found that Italian dishes are the largest category.
- Most expensive item vs least expensive item identified.
- Average dish price calculated per category.

Orders Analysis
- Order data spans a wide date range.
- Some customers placed large bulk orders (12+ items).
- Orders with the highest number of items identified.

Customer Behavior
- Certain categories dominate purchases.
- Top 5 spending orders reveal premium customer choices.
- High-value orders are concentrated in specific categories.

🚀 Tech Stack
- Database: Microsoft SQL Server
- Tool: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Language: T-SQL

📈 Business Impact
- This analysis helps the restaurant:
- Optimize menu pricing by identifying underpriced or overpriced items.
